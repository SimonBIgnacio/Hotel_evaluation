# Hotel_evaluation
  Through the data set we want to understand the consumer patterns that are satisfied with hotel services.

  With the patterns obtained, we can identify the factors that affect customer satisfaction, in this way we can improve those factors/services.
  
 # Goals
 
 1. find patterns to satisfy customers
 2. predict if the customer is satisfied
 3. segment customers
 
 
# Intruccions

 1. The repository contains 2 models, one model to segment customers and another to predict customer satisfaction.
 2. There are 2 folders with each solution and its conclusions.
 3. in the src folder you will find the libraries used in both models
